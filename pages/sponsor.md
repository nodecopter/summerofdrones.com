# Sponsor The Summer of Drones

The summer of drones is a series of up to 34 events scheduled for June -
September 2013 to take place in various cities across North America and Europe.

Each event will have up to 45 developers get together for a full day of
programming flying robots with JavaScript or other languages.

The individual events will be organized by local community members, and one
event will take place every Saturday in North America and Europe each. This
should allow for over 1500 developers to attend.

The summer of drones is unique event, unlike anything before it, and whether your goal is brand exposure, recruiting, or something else, we have a sponsorship opportunity for you.

## About

On October 5th, 2012 [we](http://nodecopter.com/core) organized an event in
Berlin called [NodeCopter](http://nodecopter.com/). The event was incredibly
successful, and thanks to being pre-event of
[JSConf.eu](http://2012.jsconf.eu/), attended by a very international audience.

After the event many attendees and followers on the internet contacted us about
bringing similar events to their cities, which resulted in additional events
that took place in Dublin, San Francisco, Seattle and Brighton.

However, organizing these individual events is very in-efficient and costly, so
we created the Summer of Drones to reduce the costs for individual events by
buying a large amount of drones and sharing them between the events.

The primary benefit from these events is education. Developers who are usually
involved in the front- or backend aspects of web development are given the
chance to learn about robotics. This turns out to be a fun way to discover new
algorithms and techniques that can be surprisingly related to the challenges
faced in modern web applications.

Additionally the events are also great networking opportunities.

As part of the summer of drones, we are extending our educational mission to
the next generation of programmers. This is done by donating all purchased drones
and equipment to [Coder Dojos](http://coderdojo.com/) around the world after
the project ends in September.
